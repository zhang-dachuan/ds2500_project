Jason Derulo, oh!
Savage love
Trixy Cloth baby
If I woke up without ya
I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever
'Til I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of keeping me comin' back to back
I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex-lover but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby I know she creepin', I feel it in the air
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
When you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage love-love-love
Your savage love-love-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that (Your savage)
Baby I hope that this ain't karma 'cause I get around
You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of making me spend up all my cash
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
When you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage love-love-love
Your savage love-love-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that your savage love
Your savage love-love-love
Your savage love-love-love
You could use me
Baby
Savage love (Oh girl)
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
When you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage love (Savage love)
Your savage love-love-love (Ooh yeah)
Your savage love-love-love
Girl you could use me
'Cause I still want that your savage love
