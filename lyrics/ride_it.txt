
(Ride it, we're all alone)
(Ride it, just lose control)
(Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul)
(Ride it, ride it, let me feel you)
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you

It's been about a month and twenty days
And we're going 'round and 'round, just playing silly games
Now you're saying, slow it down, not right now
Then ya wink at me and walk away
Now, let it be, let it be, let it be known
Hold on, don't go
Touching and teasing me, telling me no
But this time I need to feel you

Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you

Movida was the club on Saturday
Ya actin' like a diva, sayin' you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be ya feisty style, raised eyebrow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a mojito at the bar
We applying lippy cause it came off from the glass
The DJ plays your favorite song, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance
Mmm, pullin' me, pullin' me, pullin' me close
Just close your eyes, girl
Whispering, tellin' me we gotta go
Won't you take me home, I wanna

Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you

Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you

Won't you take me home, I wanna
Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you
