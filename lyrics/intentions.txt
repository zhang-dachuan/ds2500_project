Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen, cooking up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

Shout out to your mom and dad for making you
Standing ovation, they did a great job raising you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news

Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch I can't refuse (No, I can't refuse it)

Already pass, you don't need no approval
Good everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal
Second to none, you got the upper hand now
Don't need a sponsor, nope, you're the brand now

You're my rock, my Colorado
Get that ring, just like Toronto
Love you now, a little more tomorrow
This how I feel
Act like you know that you are
