(I'll bring you flowers in the pouring rain)

(Oh yeah) from this day until the day we throw it all away
Let's talk about it 'cause I can't do without it
Your love, means so much to me
Can't you see?
Right here, I'll always be (oh baby)

Oh by the way
Did I say that I am here to stay?
Right here beside you
I will never deny you, my love
You're everything to me
Can't you see
I'll give it to you unselfishly?

Because I need you so, oh baby
And I will never, ever let you go

I'll bring you flowers in the pouring rain
Living without you is driving me insane
I'll bring you flowers, I'll make your day
Those tears you cry, I'll dry them all away, away

I'll bring you flowers in the pouring rain
Living without you is driving me insane
I'll bring you flowers, I'll make your day
Those tears you cry, I'll dry them all away, away

Oh baby (oi Nathan!)
Always be, oh baby (oh yeah)
Did I say?
Oh baby
Always, be

Yo roses are red and violets are blue
You was on me and I was on you
Met this girl inside the venue
Michelin star I like the menu (oh baby)
Yeah I took her out, the night was on me
Might want you yeah if you want me
Didn't get home 'til quarter past three
You can get a son and daughter off me
Yeah, I got you purple flowers and green
We can stay up all night and get lean
I can give thing's to you that you dream
Might go halves on a brand new team (oh baby)
And I'll stand in the pouring rain for ya
And I'll change my stupid ways for ya
Cuz your love sends me crazier
Just never ever let me go

I'll bring you flowers in the pouring rain
Living without you is driving me insane
I'll bring you flowers, they'll make your day
Those tears you cry, I'll dry them all away, away

Never, never, never
Never gonna leave you, leave you

Never gonna leave you, leave you
I'll be on you need too, need too
