Own it, girl, you just own it
'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
Lighters up, lighters up
One time, lighters up
Pulled up in the party
When you saw me I was lighting up my J
So go ahead and brighten up my day
Lighters in the air when you're lighting up the rave
And it's feeling like I met you here before ('Fore)
Girl, I felt your presence when they let you through the door (Door)
Never had a bruddah give you everything and more
So I take a little piece and the rest of it is yours
Mi amor, I
E don tey wey I don dey I tell you
But, girl, you think say nah play (Ay, ay, ay)
I know no wetin you dey do me
Wey just dey scatter my brain (Ah, scatter my brain)
Thug lovin' when I put you in your place
I can tell you love it just by lookin' in your face
It's the way that you wind up your waist
I'm so in awe, girl, you never have to worry 'bout nothing
You know it's all yours, you know you
Own it
Girl, you just own it
'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
(Everybody, body, body, body, body, oluwaburna ti de)
Lights down for the one I love
Right now (Right now), we never looked better
Forget our friends, girl, I love it when we chill together
And ain't nobody gonna feel how we feel together
She wanna kiss, I, I want another one
You got a sick vibe, I wanted more than one
Up to now, nobody knew where I was coming from
But we got the same mind
So I don't wanna waste time, bring it to me
Come by, that's what I need
That's right, kissin' your cheek
One time
I used to love being alone (Alone)
But now I can't stand it
Reachin' out my palm (Palm)
For you to put your hand in
Girl, you are the one and I don't understand it
How you lighting up the room with your glow?
'Cause girl, you just own it (Own it)
Girl, you just own it (Own it)
'Cause your body's on fire (Fire)
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher (Higher)
Girl, I love how you roll it (I love how you roll it)
I put my hand there (I put my hand there)
Hold it
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
Own it, own it, own it, own it
Girl, you own it, own it, own it, own it
